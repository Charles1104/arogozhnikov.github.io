<div>In&nbsp;<a href="http://brilliantlywrong.blogspot.ru/2015/01/neural-networks.html">one</a> of&nbsp;previous posts&nbsp;I said that pairwise layer doesnâ€™t seem to&nbsp;work...<br/>
	<br/>
 Well, I&nbsp;was wrong: after checking on&nbsp;higgs-boson dataset from kaggle&nbsp;I found out that this kind of&nbsp;neural network works much better than traditional ones! Hurrah!<br/>
	<br/>
 Though, much worse then GBDT, but after building AdaBoost over neural network&nbsp;I was able to&nbsp;get comparable (or&nbsp;just the same) quality. The only problem is&nbsp;GBDT trained in&nbsp;minutes, while it&nbsp;took ~24 hours for boosting over&nbsp;NN to&nbsp;train.
